            <h4><strong> By Sahil Kapur</strong></h4>
            <br>


            <div>
                <p> WASHINGTON — <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">President-elect Joe Biden</strong> predicted
                    that Republicans would have an "epiphany" after President
                    Donald Trump lost. Three weeks after the election, there's no sign of it.</p>
                <br>
                <p> <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell</strong> , R-Ky.,
                    still hasn't acknowledged Biden as president-elect. And, like
                    most Republicans, he hasn't condemned Trump's unprecedented attempts to overturn the will of the
                    voters.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>While McConnell has been silent on <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">Biden's early Cabinet
                        nominees</strong> , some ambitious senators are already
                    criticizing the group, which includes Antony Blinken for Secretary of State and Alejandro Mayorkas
                    to run
                    Homeland Security.</p>
                <br>

                <p>The GOP response to the election is an ominous sign for Biden's pitch to usher in a new era of unity
                    and
                    bipartisanship. Even in defeat, Trump's presence looms large and Republicans remain wary of
                    offending his
                    followers. Trump may have to leave office but he gets to take with him one of his most powerful
                    weapons to
                    shape party behavior: His Twitter account.</p>
                <br>

                <p><video
                        src="../video/Trump Speaks Via iPhone Speaker Into ‘Hearing’ On Baseless Fraud Claims _ Ayman Mohyeldin _ MSNBC (480p).mp4"
                        controls width="100%"></video></p>
                <br>
                <p> On the cusp of a Thanksgiving weekend during a raging pandemic and economic crisis that Biden is
                    poised to
                    inherit, progressives want him to reset expectations.</p>
                <br>

                <p>"The epiphany is not happening and for his own sake it's time for Biden to shift gears," said Adam
                    Jentleson, a former Senate Democratic leadership aide. "It was fine as empty political rhetoric but
                    continuing to lean into it just sets Biden up to fail. If he keeps pressing the idea that he can
                    usher in a
                    new era of bipartisanship, all Republicans have to do is deny him cooperation and he will have
                    failed to
                    deliver on one of his central promises."
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>Presidents typically get some Cabinet nominees confirmed by the Senate on their first day in office.
                    McConnell's office did not comment when asked if that tradition will extend to Biden. Unless
                    Democrats win
                    both Georgia seats in the Jan. 5 runoff, he'll be the <strong
                        style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">first president since 1989</strong> to take office without his
                    party controlling both chambers of Congress.</p>
                <br>

                <p>en. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">tweeted</strong> that Biden's
                    nominees were "a group of corporatists and war enthusiasts —
                    and #BigTech sellouts." Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., called them Ivy League graduates who have "strong
                    resumes"
                    and "will be polite & orderly caretakers of America's decline."</p>
                <br>


                <p>McConnell is known to hold his cards close to the vest, read the political winds and pick his moments
                    to
                    exercise power. He demonstrated a penchant for aggressive obstruction under President Barack Obama,
                    but
                    proved somewhat more amenable on administration personnel.</p>
                <br>

                <p> Some Republicans say his indulgence of Trump is about Georgia.</p>
                <br>

                <p>"I don't read much into McConnell's silence. I think he's trying to show some deference to Trump in
                    hopes of
                    promoting party unity ahead of the Georgia runoff," said Alex Conant, a Republican campaign veteran
                    who
                    has
                    also worked in the Senate.</p>
                <br>

                <h2><strong>'A great, great epiphany'</strong></h2>
                <br>
                <p>On the campaign trail last year, Biden repeatedly promised a GOP "epiphany" after Trump was out of
                    the
                    way.
                    He <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">paused on using that word</strong> during the heat of
                    Democratic primary contests, but returned to it in July,
                    saying at a fundraiser that "if we can't unite the country, we're dead."</p>
                <br>

                <p>"With Donald Trump gone, the fear of retribution has been taken away," Biden told donors, according
                    to
                    <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);"> Bloomberg News</strong> . "If we win as big as we
                    possibly can, there's going to be a great, great epiphany that's
                    going to take place, as we Catholics say. And they're going to begin to wonder about whether or not
                    if
                    they
                    take me on and lose by just being obstructionist."
                </p>
                <br>


                <p>If Republicans win one Georgia race, they'll keep the Senate. If they lose both, the chamber will
                    split
                    50-50 and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris can cast the tie-breaking vote to give Democrats
                    control.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Conant said he expects qualified nominees to be confirmed in a GOP-led Senate, though he noted that
                    the
                    hearings could be contentious. He said the Republican Party has some soul-searching to do.</p>
                <br>

                <p>"Losing the White House is difficult for any party and there is always a leadership vacuum
                    afterwards,"
                    Conant said. "While I think many Republicans will be open to working with Biden on bipartisan
                    initiatives,
                    opposition to Democrats' more left-wing policies may be the one thing that really keeps Republicans
                    united."</p>
                <br>

                <p>Some of the president's critics don't expect the party to shed its Trumpian colors. One of them is
                    Tim
                    Miller, a veteran GOP operative who worked to defeat Trump and officially left the party this week.
                </p>
                <br>

                <p>"Sitting here today watching these Republican a--holes sit silently while the president trashes our
                    democracy with preposterous conspiracies and becomes the first modern president to refuse to concede
                    an
                    election, it’s clear that any hopes for reconciliation were folly," Miller wrote.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Trump's groundless claims of widespread fraud and a "rigged election" appear to have taken root
                    inside
                    his
                    party. In a recent Monmouth poll, 76 percent of Republicans said they're not confident the 2020
                    election
                    was
                    conducted fairly and accurately.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Despite Trump's defeat, Republicans over-performed the polls, gaining House seats and winning many
                    competitive Senate contests. That has prevented the sort of blowout election that Biden and the
                    Democrats
                    were counting on to crush the remnants of Trumpism in his party.</p>
                <br>
                <p>In a Morning Consult/Politico poll out this week, 68 percent of GOP voters said Trump is more in
                    touch
                    with
                    them than are Republicans in Congress. In a hypothetical 2024 primary, 54 percent favor Trump, with
                    Vice
                    President Mike Pence next at 12 percent.

                    "He's a political phenom," said <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);"> former GOP Rep. Jack
                        Kingston of Georgia</strong>. "He knows — in that simplistic
                    World Wrestling Entertainment background and reality TV — he knows how to simplify difficult issues
                    and
                    appeal to people and convince them that he's the man on their side."
