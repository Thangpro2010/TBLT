            <h4><strong> By Dante Chinni </strong></h4>
            <br>
            <p> WASHINGTON — A little more than a year ago, the Meet the Press team identified five counties to watch as
                part of an effort called County to County. The goal was to use those counties to explore larger trends
                in the electorate to get a feel for how different kinds of voters were reacting during the 2020
                campaign. </p>
            <br>

            <p> With the votes in, it's time to look into those five counties and how they explain the election. They
                turned out to be excellent barometers for the areas important to understand. </p>
            <br>

            <p> To begin alphabetically, it's worth looking at whether Beaver County in Pennsylvania, a blue-collar
                suburb of Pittsburgh that strongly supported President Donald Trump in 2016, continued to support
                president in this cycle. Early on it seemed likely to do so, with a little erosion in this crucial part
                of his base in Pennsylvania and in other Great Lake states. </p>
            <br>
            <p><img src="../images/2020-election_img/elec14.jpg" alt="" width="80%"></p>
            <br>

            <p> It turns out that is largely what happened. Trump still won Beaver by a large margin, more than 17
                points, but that was a point less than he won the county by in 2016. And that pattern appeared across
                the Upper Midwest, with Trump winning again in key blue-collar suburbs such as Macomb County in Michigan
                and Berks in Pennsylvania, but by less than four years ago — losses that would up being crucial in close
                states. </p>

            <p> In Kent County, Michigan, the former home of Gerald Ford, the question was whether a long-time home of
                wealthier, establishment Republicans would stand by the president in 2020. Interviews and poll data
                suggested they were the kinds of Republicans who were most uncomfortable with him. </p>
            <br>
            <p><img src="../images/2020-election_img/elec15.jpg" alt="" width="80%"></p>
            <br>

            <p> And indeed, Kent flipped and voted for Joe Biden this year, after backing Trump in 2016. The county
                swung by more than 9 points toward the Democrat. And there were similar swings in percentage, if not
                outright flips, in similar counties around the country, including Douglas in Colorado and Waukesha in
                Wisconsin. </p>
            <br>

            <p> In Maricopa County, Arizona, the question was how a massive growing and diversifying suburban area would
                respond to Trump after the suburban vote turned especially blue in 2018. Would those attitudes carry on
                in 2020 in a place such as the Phoenix metro area with its growing Hispanic population? </p>
            <br>
            <p><img src="../images/2020-election_img/elec16.jpg" alt="" width="80%"></p>
            <br>
            <p> Maricopa, which Trump had won narrowly in 2016 by about 3 points, also flipped to Biden, with the
                Democrat winning it by a little more than 2 points. The total margin swing was a little more than five
                points and the win in Maricopa essentially propelled Biden to win the state of Arizona. And it’s worth
                noting that swings in the big diversifying suburban area around Atlanta was instrumental to putting
                Georgia in Biden’s column as well. </p>
            <br>
            <p> The County-to-County effort went to Miami-Dade in Florida for two connected reasons. The Florida voter
                landscape is different than other states and the “Hispanic vote” that analysts often describe as a
                single entity is actually an extremely complicated mosaic of people and interests. In particular, it
                seemed likely the Cuban and Venezuelan voters in the area might be more sensitive to the word
                “socialism.” </p>
            <br>
            <p><img src="../images/2020-election_img/elec17.jpg" alt="" width="80%"></p>
            <br>

            <p> That thought proved to be accurate. Of the five counties in the group, Miami-Dade was the only one where
                Trump improved on his 2016 margin and by a massive 22 percentage points. Remarkably, the 2020 results
                show that Biden essentially got the same number of votes out of the county as Hillary Clinton did in
                2016, but Trump got an additional 200,000 votes out of Miami-Dade, a county that is almost 70 percent
                Hispanic. </p>
            <br>
            <p> And County to County went to Milwaukee County in Wisconsin to see if Democrats could fire up and bring
                out their crucial base of African-American voters. A decline in the number of votes from Milwaukee was a
                big reason why Trump won Wisconsin in 2016. </p>
            <br>
            <p><img src="../images/2020-election_img/elec18.jpg" alt="" width="80%"></p>
            <br>

            <p> And Biden did improve the Democrats’ margin and their turnout in Milwaukee this year. Not only did he do
                about 3 percentage points better than Hillary Clinton in the county, he netted roughly 20,000 more
                votes. It wasn’t a stellar performance for Biden in the county — Dane County, home of the University of
                Wisconsin turned out a lot more votes — but it was good enough. </p>
            <br>
            <p> Again, that story was repeated in other big cities in the upper Midwest, not massive turnout or margin,
                but better than 2016 and, overall, enough to get the ball across the goal line for Biden. </p>
            <br>

            <p> These five counties, and the five stories around them, turned out to be crucial elements of the 2020
                campaign. And even though the election is over, the Meet the Press team won’t be abandoning the
                County-to-County approach to political coverage. Working with the data and county experts of the
                American Communities Project at George Washington University, the team plans to keep finding places that
                help explain the nation’s complicated political landscape. </p>
