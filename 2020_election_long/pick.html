            <br>
            <h4><strong> By Lauren Egan </strong></h4> <br>

            <p> MARIETTA, Ga. — Georgia voters don't even have to get out of their cars these days to meet a candidate
                for
                the Senate.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p> On Wednesday morning in Cobb County, one the largest Atlanta suburbs, dozens of voters slowly inched
                down
                the street leading up to the horseshoe driveway in front of Turner Chapel AME Church. Music blared from
                speakers as<strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">Democratic Senate candidate Jon Ossoff</strong>
                chatted with voters while staffers loaded yard signs
                into
                cars. Everyone wore masks and kept at a distance.</p>
            <br>
            <p>But some Georgia Democrats are warning that while events like Ossoff's drive-thru yard sign pickup are a
                creative way to campaign during the coronavirus pandemic, the party will need to rethink its ground
                game,
                particularly <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">door-to-door canvassing</strong> , if it hopes to
                win in January.</p>
            <br>

            <p> "A safe, socially distanced return to in-person door-knocking is a must," said Howard Franklin, an
                Atlanta-based Democratic consultant, adding that the election "post-mortem" suggested that Democrats'
                decision to halt nearly all in-person campaigning might have led to the party's underperformance in some
                down-ballot races.</p>
            <br>

            <p>"When you look at the Democratic coalition, they're not all going to have the technology to be on a Zoom
                call or have the time to jump in their car and run across town. These are luxuries," Franklin said.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Georgia Democrats are celebrating <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);"> President-elect Joe Biden's
                    narrow win in the state</strong>, but nationally, the
                party is also grappling with losses in well-funded Senate races — from <strong
                    style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">Maine</strong> to <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">North
                    Carolina</strong> — that
                have
                raised the stakes in Georgia's two Senate runoffs on Jan. 5.</p>
            <br>
            <p><video

            <br>
            <p> Democrats face two <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);"> well-funded Republican
                    candidates</strong>. Ossoff is running against Sen. David Perdue, while
                Democrat Raphael Warnock is up against Sen. Kelly Loeffler.</p>
            <br>

            <p> What the Democrats' ground game will look like in the Georgia runoffs remains unclear.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Party leaders and campaign staffers say they are starting to have conversations about returning to
                in-person
                door-knocking, and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee last week announced a
                multimillion-dollar
                field effort in the state, including on-the-ground organizers.</p>
            <br>
            <p>"I think we have figured out safe ways to campaign in person," Ellen Foster, Ossoff's campaign manager,
                said
                in a news briefing Nov. 6. "Every tactic is on the table, and we'll implement what we think is safe in
                the
                coming weeks."
            </p>
            <br>
            <p> In the November election, both Perdue and Loeffler benefited from President Donald Trump's general
                election
                operation, when <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">thousands of staffers and volunteers </strong>
                were deployed around the country to reach
                low-propensity voters. The Trump campaign maintained throughout the election that door-knocking was done
                at
                a social distance and that staffers were asked to wear masks.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Biden campaign, on the other hard, largely shied away from in-person contact with voters out of
                health
                concerns. Instead, it relied on supporters to text or call people in their networks to get out the vote.
                Many Democrats down the ballot followed the campaign's lead.</p>
            <br>
            <p> Decades of political science research suggests that one of the most effective ways to turn out voters is
                to
                encourage them to show up at the polls in high-quality face-to-face conversations. Republicans largely
                have
                had a monopoly on those in-person conversations.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Even some national Democrats warned that a total abandonment of door-to-door canvassing might harm
                Democratic efforts.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);"> wrote on
                    Twitter</strong> shortly after the election that "the decision to
                stop knocking doors is one people need to grapple with and analyze," pointing to some competitive races
                in
                which Democrats bucked the top of the ticket, kept knocking on doors and won.</p>
            <br>
            <p><video
                    src="../video/democratic-candidates-fight-to-win-georgia-votes-and-to-ultimately-take-the-senate-majority.mp4"
                    controls style="width: 100%;"></video></p>
            <br>

            <p> But even now, few Democrats are ready to offer concrete details or commitments to expand their in-person
                contact with voters, particularly as their plans have been complicated by the worsening pandemic.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Georgia hit its highest single-day total of <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">new Covid-19
                    cases</strong> in more than three months on Tuesday, a
                number many fear will continue to climb after the Thanksgiving holiday. Early voting starts shortly
                after
                the holiday, on Dec. 14.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>"Right now, these conversations are small. They've not been too big yet," said Bianca Keaton, chairwoman
                of
                the Gwinnett County Democrats, speaking of plans to reach voters face to face.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Keaton said she was hopeful that with the right precautions and personal protective equipment, she would
                be
                able to start a "strong, in-person canvassing operation" in Gwinnett County.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>"My hope and prayer is that folks continue to do that kind of engagement in a safe manner. The cure for
                coronavirus in many respects and many other things that have ailed Americans are on the ballot in
                January,"
                she said.</p>
            <br>

            <p>"The stakes are extremely high, and in-person canvassing is a necessary part of this."</p>
