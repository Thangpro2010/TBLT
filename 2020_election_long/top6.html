            <h4><strong> By Lauren Egan, Nicole Via y Rada and Dareh Gregorian</strong></h4>
            <br>


            <p>President-elect Joe Biden said Wednesday that the country is facing a "long hard winter" because of the
                <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);"> coronavirus</strong> but vowed that "life is going to return
                to normal."</p>
            <br>
            <p>"There's real hope, tangible hope, so hang on," Biden said in a pre-Thanksgiving address from Wilmington,
                Delaware, noting that <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">Covid-19 vaccines</strong> will start
                being deployed in December.</p>
            <br>

            <p>"Then we'll need to put in place the distribution plan to get the entire country immunized as soon as
                possible — which we will do. But it's going to take time," Biden cautioned. Until then, "we need to
                steel
                our spines and redouble our efforts" to combat the virus with social distancing, good hygiene and masks,
                he
                said.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>"None of the steps we are asking people to take are political statements," he added, repeatedly calling
                for
                unity. "We're at war with a virus. Not one another," Biden said.</p>
            <br>

            <p>"I'm hoping the news of the vaccine will serve as an incentive to every American to take these simple
                steps
                to get control of the virus," he said. "Don't let yourself surrender to the fatigue, which I understand
                it
                is real fatigue. I know we can beat this virus. America is not going to lose this war. We'll get our
                lives
                back. Life is going to return to normal. I promise you this will happen. This will not last forever."
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>Biden said he has a long tradition of traveling for a large family gathering for Thanksgiving, but he
                said
                he's not doing so this year and will celebrate the holiday with his wife and their daughter and
                son-in-law
                in Wilmington.</p>
            <br>

            <p>He said that with the coronavirus death toll's hitting <strong
                    style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">260,000</strong> in the U.S., he knew the holiday would be
                hard for many families.</p>
            <br>

            <p>"For those who've lost a loved one, I know that this time of year can be particularly difficult. Believe
                me,
                I know," said Biden, whose first wife and daughter were killed in a car accident in 1972.</p>
            <br>

            <p>"I remember the first Thanksgiving and the empty chair, the silence. It takes your breath away. It's
                really
                hard to care. It's hard to give thanks. It's hard to even think of looking forward. It's so hard to
                hope. I
                understand. I'll be thinking and praying for each and every one of you," he said.</p>
            <br>

            <p>On Thursday morning, the president-elect released a video on social media of him and his wife, Jill,
                speaking about the holiday. Biden emphasized that staying home is a personal sacrifice but also a
                "shared
                sacrifice for the whole country."</p>

            <br>

            <p>As for things to be thankful for, Biden pointed Wednesday to the record voter turnout in the election.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>"Let's be thankful for democracy itself," he said. "In the middle of a pandemic, more people voted this
                year
                than have ever voted in the history of the United States of America. Over 150 million people cast a
                ballot.
                It's simply extraordinary.</p>
            <br>

            <p> "Our democracy was tested this year. and what we learned is this — the people of this nation are up to
                the
                task. In America, we have full and fair and free elections, and then we honor the results. The people of
                this nation and the laws of the land won't stand for anything else," he added.</p>
            <br>

            <p>As Biden started to speak in Delaware, President Donald Trump was addressing a gathering of Republican
                state
                legislators <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">at a hotel in Pennsylvania</strong> by phone,
                continuing to claim that the election was rigged against
                him.</p>
            <br>

            <p>"We have to turn the election over, because there's no doubt we have all the evidence, we have all the
                affidavits, we have everything," Trump said during a 10-minute-long rant while providing no evidence of
                his
                various allegations. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani attended the makeshift hearing about voter complaints
                and
                also spoke.</p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p> <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">Coronavirus</strong> cases continue to increase around the
                country, raising alarm among some health officials that
                holiday travel and indoor gatherings could lead to more outbreaks. The country is also facing a surge in
                food insecurity due to the impact of the virus, with food banks around the country <strong
                    style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">reporting long lines</strong>
                ahead of the holiday.</p>
            <br>

            <p>The speech followed Trump's traditional turkey pardoning Tuesday, when he touted a record stock market
                but
                made no mention of the record number of Covid-19 cases.</p>
            <br>

            <p>In other transition news:</p>
            <br>

            <p>Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, went to DC Central Kitchen in Washington
                to
                thank workers who have been feeding the hungry. They said they plan to spend Thanksgiving with each
                other.
                Asked whether she has spoken to Vice President Mike Pence, Harris said, "Not yet."
                Outgoing Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., California Attorney General Xavier Becerra and former Deputy Attorney
                General Sally Yates are under consideration to be attorney general in the Biden administration, two
                sources
                familiar with the matter said.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Biden will receive his first presidential daily briefing Monday, his transition advisers told reporters.
                Biden senior adviser Kate Bedingfield said Wednesday that "we don't feel it's necessary" for Biden to
                speak
                directly with Trump. "Certainly, should President Trump want to speak with President-elect Biden, then
                that's something we would work out in the future. But in terms of whether it's mission critical to being
                able to move the transition forward efficiently? No," Bedingfield said.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on ABC's
                "Good Morning America" that he has been in contact with Ron Klain, Biden's incoming White House chief of
                staff, now that the transition process is formally underway. "Nothing substantive in the sense of plans,
                but
                just touching base with me," Fauci said.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Moncef Slaoui, chief adviser to Operation Warp Speed, said on "CBS This Morning" that his team has "not
                yet
                been in contact" with the Biden team but that he expected those contacts to start soon. Alex Azar, the
                secretary of health and human services, "has said that we are ready to discuss and of course share all
                information that we have, and we will be happy to do it," Slaoui said.</p>
            <br>
            <p> Biden said Tuesday in an <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">exclusive interview with NBC News'
                    Lester Holt</strong> that the Trump administration has
                already begun to reach out to his transition team, and he <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">
                    described the effort</strong> as "sincere," a day after a
                federal agency released a letter to formally begin the transition of power.</p>
            <br>
            <p> <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">Biden introduced key nominees</strong> for his Cabinet and his
                national security team Tuesday, including Antony
                Blinken as secretary of state, Alejandro Mayorkas as secretary of homeland security, Avril Haines as
                director of <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">national intelligence, Linda Thomas-Greenfield as
                    the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations</strong> ,
                Jake Sullivan as national security adviser and John Kerry as special envoy for climate.</p>
