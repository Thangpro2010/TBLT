            <p> ATLANTA — Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler is quarantining after receiving inconclusive Covid-19 test
                results
                on
                Saturday following multiple campaign appearances earlier in the week. </p>
            <br>
            <p> Loeffler was retested overnight and those results came back negative on Sunday, campaign
                spokesperson
                Stephen Lawson said in a statement. He added that she would continue self-isolate and undergo more
                testing
                "out of an abundance of caution." </p>
            <br>
            <p> According to her campaign, Loeffler took two rapid tests Friday morning, which came back negative.
                She
                was
                later informed that her PCR test, considered the gold standard in detecting genetic material
                specific to
                the
                coronavirus, was positive. She was then re-tested on Saturday morning and those results were
                inconclusive.
                Loeffler has not been exhibiting symptoms, Lawson said. </p>
            <br>

            <p> Loeffler, a Republican locked in a competitive runoff race that could determine the balance of power
                in
                Congress, attended <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">two campaign events on Friday</strong>
                alongside Vice President Mike Pence. </p>
            <br>
            <p> In photos shared on Twitter, neither Loeffler nor Pence appeared to be wearing masks. </p>
            <br>

            <p> In a statement, Pence's Press Secretary Devin O’Malley said, "As he awaits a confirmatory test from
                Senator
                Loeffler, Vice President Pence is in regular consultation with the White House Medical Unit and will
                be
                following CDC guidelines as he has in other circumstances when he has been a close contact."</p>
            <br>
            <p> Pence's office has said he is tested every day for Covid-19. </p>
            <br>

            <p> Last month, two of Loeffler's staffers tested positive for the coronavirus, but she did not appear
                to be
                infected, <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">The Associated Press reported</strong>. She also
                had a previous coronavirus scare after attending a
                news
                conference in the White House Rose Garden on Sept. 26 when President Donald Trump announced Amy
                Coney
                Barrett as his pick for the U.S. Supreme Court. Trump later tested positive for Covid-19. </p>
            <br>

                    controls style="width: 100%;"></video></p>

            <p> Loeffler's Democratic opponent, the Rev. Raphael Warnock, tweeted that he hopes for a quick recovery
                for
                her. </p>
            <br>

            <p> "I pray that her test results come back negative and that she is back on the campaign trail soon,"
                he
                said. </p>
            <br>
            <p> The closely watched contest between Warnock and Loeffler will be decided on Jan. 5 when Georgia
                voters
                will
                determine the fates of both Senate seats. </p>
            <br>
            <p> <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">Loeffler has aligned herself with Sen. David
                    Perdue</strong> , a Republican who is facing a runoff against Jon
                Ossoff.
                Loeffler and Perdue have been holding joint rallies and are presenting themselves as a united front.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p> A sp okesman for Perdue said the senator will remain at home until Loeffler receives confirmation of
                her
                test
                results. </p>
            <br>

            <p> In March, Loeffler was among multiple senators under fire for <strong
                    style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">selling off major stock holdings</strong> after
                receiving early classified congressional briefings on the coronavirus pandemic but before dire
                warnings
                of
                the virus were made public by officials. The Justice Department later closed its insider trading
                investigations into Loeffler and others. </p>
