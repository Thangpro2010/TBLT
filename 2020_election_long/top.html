            <h4><strong> By Dartunorro Clark </strong></h4>
            <br>

            <p>With <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">Joe Biden now projected</strong> to win the presidency,
                his running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, also solidified her place in history Saturday by becoming the
                first woman, the first Black American and the first <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">South
                    Asian American</strong> elected vice president in U.S. history.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Harris’ political career has included many barrier-breaking moments, such as serving as California's
                first Black female attorney general and being the second Black woman in history to be elected to the
                U.S. Senate.</p>
            <br>
            <p> <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">Harris</strong> , 56, the only Black woman currently in the
                Senate, was elected in 2016 after serving as California’s attorney general and, before that, as the San
                Francisco district attorney. The child of Jamaican and Indian immigrants, the native of Oakland,
                California, has said she was inspired to attend law school after attending civil rights protests with
                her parents.</p>
            <br>
            <p><video
                    src="../video/Kamala Harris makes history in U.S. becoming first woman, Black and Asian American vice president (360p).mp4"
                    controls width="100%"></video></p>
            <br>
            <p>Before Harris made history in the ivory halls of Congress and on the Democratic presidential ticket, her
                sharp debate skills and understanding of her multiracial heritage were honed at Howard University, one
                of the most prestigious historically Black colleges in the country.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Harris, a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the historically Black sorority she joined while at Howard, will
                also be the first vice president from a historically Black Greek-letter organization.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Harris’ mother, Shyamala Gopalan, who immigrated to the United States at the age of 19 to pursue a
                doctorate in nutrition and endocrinology at the University of California, Berkeley, had an immense
                impact on Harris and her sister, Maya. The senator has spoken about how Gopalan, a civil rights
                activist, was a role model for her despite the challenges she faced as an immigrant and later as a
                single mother, forging a life in the United States.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Gopalan met Harris’ father, Donald, while participating in civil rights protests. They eventually
                divorced, with her raising the children on her own. Gopalan was cognizant that most people would see her
                children as Black and was “determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud Black women,”
                Harris wrote in her autobiography, “The Truths We Hold.” However, Gopalan also made efforts to nurture
                her children’s Indian heritage.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Picking Harris also provided the ticket with generational diversity. Biden, who will turn 78 later this
                month, is the oldest president-elect in U.S. history.</p>
            <br>

            <p>The Democratic Party and the campaign argued that the ticket could bring together a racially diverse
                coalition of voters to take back the White House to rescue the economy and protect American lives as the
                coronavirus pandemic shows no signs of slowing down. The ticket also promised to heal racial and
                partisan divides.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Harris, who was also a 2020 presidential hopeful, garnered attention early in the primary when she
                clashed with Biden over racial issues during the first Democratic debate. Biden later said the clash was
                surprising because, as attorney general, Harris <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">worked closely
                    with her Delaware counterpart, Biden’s son Beau Biden</strong> .</p>
            <br>

            <p>But it was no shock when Biden tapped her to be his running mate. Political observers have noted that
                Harris' place on the ticket resonated with voters of color, and was also indicative of the power and
                influence Black women have as a voting bloc in the country and particularly in the Democratic Party.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Harris’ record as a prosecutor, especially on issues such as <strong
                    style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">marijuana convictions</strong> and <strong
                    style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">truancy</strong> , was seen as both an asset and a liability both
                during her own unsuccessful run for the Democratic nomination and when Biden tapped her to be his
                running mate. A prosecutor’s polish was helpful as she campaigned and participated in debates, but her
                record was a source of concern to younger, more progressive voters, particularly young Black voters.</p>
            <br>

            <p>During both her primary run and as the vice presidential nominee, Harris touched on the legacy of Black
                women who paved the way for her. She gave her acceptance speech during the Democratic National
                Convention around the time of the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to
                vote. Harris noted, however, that right came much later for most Black women, who helped secure that
                victory but were still barred from voting.</p>

            <p>Black and female lawmakers Saturday noted the trailblazing moment.</p>
            <br>

            <p>"4 years ago, <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">@KamalaHarris</strong> became the first South
                Asian American woman ever elected to the Senate," <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">Rep. Pramila
                    Jayapal, D-Wash., tweeted</strong> . "Now, she's the Vice President-Elect of the United States!!
                We've not only shattered ceilings, but we've constructed a different path for millions as they imagine
                their own futures."</p>
            <br>

            <p>"Now more than ever, our country’s leadership is more reflective of our diverse and dynamic country,"
                said Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">whose endorsement</strong> was
                widely considered <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">to have been instrumental</strong> to
                Biden's securing the Democratic nomination.</p>
            <br>

            <p>"I feel like our ancestors are rejoicing," Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., tweeted. "For the first time, a
                Black and South Asian woman has been elected Vice President of the United States. My sister has made
                history and blazed a trail for future generations to follow. We love you, <strong
                    style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">@KamalaHarris</strong>."</p>
            <br>

            <p>Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University, told NBC News in a
                phone interview that Harris' election shows Black women taking their "rightful places of leadership
                within the party, given how important they are to Democratic victories around the country."</p>
            <br>

            <p>"I think that's actually really important because it is centering women of color in the history and story
                of women in the United States in ways that they haven't been before," she said.

                Gillespie added, "Now it becomes a question of, who else does she open doors for?"</p>
