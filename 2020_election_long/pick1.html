            <h4><strong> By Suzy Khimm </strong></h4>
            <br>
            <p>While President Donald Trump continues to deny the results of the election, his administration is
                beginning
                to
                press forward to cement new regulations and other policy changes before President-elect Joe Biden’s
                inauguration
                — rules that will be challenging to undo once they are finalized.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Three days after the election, the Department of Agriculture <strong
                    style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">sent a proposal </strong> to the White House that
                would
                allow
                poultry plants to increase their line speeds — a <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">move</strong>
                that the Obama administration had previously
                rejected</strong>
                for
                fear of endangering meatpacking workers.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The proposal is among the <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);"> 145 rules </strong> that the
                White House’s Office of Management and Budget is currently
                evaluating as a key step in the <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">formal rule-making
                    process</strong> for major regulations. Other significant
                regulations
                — <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">defined</strong> as having a large impact on the
                economy, the environment, public health and safety, or state
                and
                local
                governments — could come under White House review in the coming days and could potentially be
                completed
                before
                Trump leaves office.</p>
            <br>
            <p>While it’s not likely that all of these draft rules will be finalized before Trump's term ends, both
                critics
                and
                supporters of the administration say they expect a final burst of regulations to be finalized in the
                weeks
                before Jan. 20, as <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">presidents from both parties have
                    done</strong> since the Carter administration.</p>
            <br>

            <p> “They’re running up against the clock,” said Nicolas Loris, an economist who focuses on energy and
                the
                environment at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. “They need to finish under
                deadline,
                but
                also
                make sure they cross their t’s and dot their i’s, so they can survive any legal challenges.”</p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>The rules under development include policies that the incoming Biden administration would probably
                oppose,
                such
                as <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);"> new caps on the length of foreign student
                    visas</strong>; restrictions on the Environmental Protection
                Agency’s <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">use of scientific research</strong> ; limits on
                the EPA’s consideration of the <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">benefits of regulating air
                    pollutants</strong> ;
                and
                a
                change that would make it easier for companies to treat workers as <strong
                    style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">independent contractors</strong> , rather
                than
                employees with more robust wage protections.</p>
            <br>
            <p>“They’re clearly racing,” said Deborah Berkowitz of the National Employment Law Project, a research
                and
                worker
                protection advocacy group, who says that increasing line speeds in poultry plants will <strong
                    style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">create unsafe
                    working conditions</strong> . “The Trump administration has decided to appease the poultry
                industry. And they’re doing it
                at
                the
                last minute, very quickly.” </p>
            <br>
            <p>The White House did not respond to a request for comment. But the Department of Agriculture denied
                that
                it
                was
                rushing new rules out the door, as the proposals now under review have been publicly in the works
                for
                years.</p>
            <br>

            <p>“The agency has stated over and over again that a poultry line speed proposed rule is coming,” the
                USDA
                said
                in
                a statement, pointing to the administration’s <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);"> previous
                    effort</strong> to grant individual waivers for line speed
                increases. “To frame this as ‘midnight rule-making’ is untrue and absurd.”</p>
            <br>

            <br>
            <p>The poultry industry — which has been pushing for line speed increases since the beginning of the
                Trump
                administration — describes the latest development as the culmination of a decades-long process,
                stretching
                back
                to a pilot program under the Clinton administration.</p>
            <br>
            <p>“This is not a political issue,” said Tom Super, a spokesman for the National Chicken Council, which
                represents
                poultry plants.
            </p> <br>
            <p>While most executive orders can be quickly reversed by the stroke of a pen — as Biden has already
                vowed
                to
                do —
                completed regulations are significantly harder to dislodge. Once a rule is officially published in
                the
                Federal
                Register, it usually requires either a court decision or the same laborious rule-making process to
                reverse.</p> <br>


            <p>Congress could potentially undo regulations faster by using the Congressional Review Act — as
                Republican
                legislators did to reverse a slew of <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">Obama-era
                    rules</strong> at the beginning of Trump’s term. But that would be
                highly
                unlikely if Republicans retain control of the Senate after Jan. 5, when two runoff elections are
                scheduled
                in
                Georgia.</p>
            <br>

            <p>“It creates a big hurdle for the next administration to overcome,” said Shev Dalal-Dheini, director
                of
                government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association. “Even if it hasn’t taken
                effect,
                it
                becomes a lot harder to overturn a regulation once it’s been published.”</p>
            <br>
            <p>“These are like booby traps,” said James Goodwin, a policy analyst for the Center for Progressive
                Reform, a
                liberal advocacy group. “You have to find all of them and disarm them, and you’re not advancing your
                own
                agenda.”</p> <br>

            <p>Jack Beermann, a professor and administrative law expert at Boston University, believes it’s natural
                for
                rule-making to speed up toward the end of an administration, especially under a one-term president.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>“People tend to think of it as nefarious, but in most administrations, the vast majority of these
                rules
                are
                routine — people tend to work to deadline,” Beermann said. But some are more contentious, such as
                complex
                environmental or worker safety rules implemented at the end of a <strong
                    style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">president’s term</strong> , he added. When
                President
                Barack Obama issued a flurry of such rules after the 2016 election, Republicans immediately vowed to
                repeal
                many
                of them through the Congressional Review Act — and <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">succeeded
                </strong> in doing so once Trump took office.</p>

            <br>

            <p>The rules currently under White House review include some proposals with broad bipartisan support,
                such
                <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);"> a new requirement </strong> for all federally subsidized
                housing to have carbon monoxide detectors. The Department of
                Housing
                and Urban Development announced in April 2019 that it would draft the rule following <strong
                    style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);"> an NBC News
                    investigation </strong>
                on carbon monoxide deaths in public housing.</p> <br>

            <p>Administration officials stressed that they were following the normal rule-making process, which by
                law
                requires
                proposed rules to be open for public comment and for the agency to respond to those comments before
                moving
                forward. “It is untrue and ridiculous that any rules or regulations published at any time are not
                open
                for
                public scrutiny,” the USDA said in a statement.</p>
            <br>

            <p>While there are steps that the executive branch can take to speed up the process — offering a 30-day
                comment
                period, instead of a 60-day one, for instance — failing to follow the proper rule-making procedure
                could
                open
                any new rules to serious legal challenges, as the Trump administration has <strong
                    style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">repeatedly found</strong> .</p>
            <br>

            <p> Susan Dudley, who led the White House’s office of regulatory affairs under President George W. Bush,
                tried
                to
                resist midnight rule-making after the 2008 election, <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">
                    concerned</strong> that it could encourage regulators to cut
                corners. But ultimately, she bent to pressure from both political and career officials eager to wrap
                things
                up.</p>
            <br>

            <p>“It’s really all hands on deck,” Dudley said. “They’ll be finishing things that have been in the
                works
                for a
                while. But you also do things that are rushed, with maybe not enough time for public comment or an
                inadequate
                analysis of what the effects of the regulation will be.”</p>
            <br>

            <p>Outside of new regulations, the president could take other types of action to advance his agenda in
                ways
                that
                could be tough to reverse. As part of the Republicans’ sweeping tax cut bill passed in 2017,
                Congress
                authorized
                oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge — a long-standing goal for the GOP that Biden
                opposes.</p>
            <br>

            <p>In August, Interior Secretary David Bernhardt said that a lease sale for drilling in the Arctic could
                happen
                by
                the end of the year. The department could also approve new permits for oil and gas drilling on other
                federal
                land, which Biden has also opposed, prompting <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">an industry
                    rush</strong> for permits in the months prior to the
                election.</p>
            <br>

            <p>“A timely and efficient permitting system has always been a priority for our industry,” Frank
                Macchiarola,
                senior vice president of the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, said in a statement.
                “Natural
                gas
                and oil production on federal lands and waters will play a critical role in the nation’s economic
                recovery.”</p>
            <br>

            <p>Once such a permit or lease is issued, it is usually difficult to claw back or challenge in court,
                said
                Goodwin,
