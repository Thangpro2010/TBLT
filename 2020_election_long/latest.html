            <h4><strong> By Allan Smith </strong></h4>
            <br>
            <p> Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a longtime ally of President Donald Trump, said Sunday that
                <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);"> Trump's legal</strong> battle over the <strong
                    style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">election results </strong> has reached the point of "national
                embarrassment" and that it is time for him to move on. </p>
            <br>
            <p> "Quite frankly, <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">the conduct of the president's legal
                    team</strong> has been a national embarrassment," Christie said in an interview on ABC News'
                "This Week." He pointed to lawyer <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">Sidney Powell's</strong>
                various <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);"> claims about voter fraud</strong> , for which she
                has been "unwilling to go on TV and defend and lay
                out the evidence that she
                supposedly has." </p>
            <br>
            <p> "This is outrageous conduct by any lawyer," Christie said, adding that Trump's team often discusses
                election fraud "outside the courtroom, but when they go inside the courtroom they don't plead fraud
                and they don't argue fraud." </p>
            <br>
            <p> Noting that he voted for Trump, Christie said: "Elections have consequences, and we cannot continue
                to
                act as if something happened here that did not happen. </p>
            <br>
            <p> "You have an obligation to present the evidence," he said. "The evidence has not been presented. And
                you
                must conclude — as [Fox News host] Tucker Carlson even concluded the other night — that if you're
                unwilling to come forward and present the evidence, it must mean the evidence doesn't exist." </p><br>
            <video
                    src="../video/chris-christie-says-he-and-other-gop-leaders-will-ensure-trump-steps-down-if-he-loses-election.mp4"

            <br><br>
            <p> A federal judge in Pennsylvania eviscerated the Trump campaign's latest legal effort, dismissing it
                and
                saying it was premised on a "strained legal argument without merit."</p>
            <br>

            <p> In a 37-page ruling, U.S. District Judge Matthew Brann wrote that the Trump campaign asked him to
                "disenfranchise almost seven million voters" in Pennsylvania, adding that with such a request, one
                might
                expect "factual proof of rampant corruption." Brann said such proof was not presented. </p>
            <br>

            <p> "In the United States of America, this cannot justify the disenfranchisement of a single voter, let
                alone all the voters of its sixth most populated state," Brann wrote. </p>
            <br>
            <p> <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);"> Trump and Republicans </strong> have filed more than 30
                lawsuits so far, with most being dismissed, withdrawn or
                rejected. No courts have found evidence of voter fraud. </p>
            <br>
            <p> Trump's legal effort is spearheaded by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, seen sweating a dark
                liquid
                down both sides of his face <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">during a free-wheeling
                    90-minute news conference Thursday.</strong> . Also at the helm is
                campaign attorney Jenna Ellis, who accused a longtime Republican pollster of having "MicroPenis
                syndrome"
                Saturday.</p>
            <br>
            <p> Powell had also been involved, appearing alongside Giuliani and Ellis last week. But the campaign
                appeared
                to cut ties with her Sunday, a day after she falsely accused election officials in Georgia of having
                been
                paid to enable voter fraud. </p>
            <br>
            <p> "Sidney Powell is practicing law on her own," Giuliani and Ellis said in a statement. "She is not a
                member
                of the Trump Legal Team. She is also not a lawyer for the President in his personal capacity."</p>
            <br>

            <p> After the Pennsylvania ruling Saturday, the Trump campaign's legal team spun the loss as a positive
                update,
                as it allowed it to more quickly expedite an appeal. </p>
            <br>

            <p> <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">Trump expressed anger on Twitter </strong> over the
                weekend, defending his legal battles and blasting Republicans
                who
                encouraged him to accept the election results. He also expressed hope that state lawmakers will
                "have
                the
                COURAGE" to ignore the vote and declare him the winner if need be. Republican legislative leaders in
                Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan have all signaled that <strong
                    style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">that will not happen.</strong> </p>
            <br>
            <p> After meeting with Trump at the White House on Friday, the Republican leaders of the Michigan state
                Senate
                and House said they were not "made aware of any information that would change the outcome of the
                election in
                Michigan." </p>
            <br>
            <p> Speaking Sunday with Fox News, Trump campaign senior adviser Lara Trump said it is still "a
                possibility"
                that legislatures could override the vote. </p>
            <br>

            <p> To overturn the vote, Trump would have to overcome deficits of more than 10,000 votes in at least
                three
                states, <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">far outside the number reversed</strong> in any
                statewide recount dating back decades. After Georgia
                certified its results following a hand recount, the Trump campaign <strong
                    style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">is requesting a separate machine recount in Georgia</strong> ,
                and it also requested a <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);"> partial recount in two
                    Democratic-leaning Wisconsin counties</strong> last week. That recount is ongoing. </p>
            <br>
            <p> NBC News has projected President-elect Joe Biden the apparent winner in both states, and, as it
                stands,
                he
                is projected to win 306 electoral votes. That is the same haul Trump won in 2016, when he called his
                victory
                a "landslide." </p>
            <br>
            <p> More elected Republicans spoke out about Trump's efforts this <strong
                    style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">weekend</strong> , although most have yet to
                acknowledge
                Biden's victory. After the Pennsylvania ruling, Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said that Trump had
                "exhausted
                all
                plausible legal options to challenge the result of the presidential race in Pennsylvania" and that
                recent
                developments make it clear that Biden will be the next president. </p>
            <br>
            <p> Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, who has previously called Biden the president-elect, described
                Trump's
                leaning on state legislators as a "pressure campaign" that was "not only unprecedented but
                inconsistent
                with
                our democratic process."

                "It is time to begin the full and formal transition process," she said Sunday in a statement.

                Because of Trump's refusal to accept the results, <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">his head
                    of the General Services Administration</strong> has
                refused to acknowledge Biden's victory, leaving the transition in limbo.

                Speaking Sunday on NBC News' "Meet the Press," Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., said "it's time to start a
                transition, to at least cooperate with a transition," although he said he is still waiting to see
                how
                Trump's legal effort plays out. </p>
            <br>
            <p> On CNN's "State of the Union," Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, said Trump's election
                efforts
                are
                "beginning to look like we're a banana republic."

                "It's time for them to stop the nonsense," Hogan said. "It just gets more bizarre every single day,
                and
                frankly, I'm embarrassed that more people in the party aren't speaking up."

                Trump soon took aim at Hogan, calling him a "RINO" — Republican in name only — on<strong
                    style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">Twitter</strong> , linking
                to a
                Breitbart writeup of a Washington Post report <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">highlighting how
                    Hogan purchased</strong> flawed coronavirus
                tests
                from
                South Korea.

                Hogan <strong style="color: rgb(34, 143, 143);">responded</strong> : "If you had done your job,
                America's governors wouldn't have been forced to fend
                for
                themselves to find tests in the middle of a pandemic, as we successfully did in Maryland. Stop
                golfing
                and
                concede."

                Elsewhere on CNN, Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich., said the voters in his state "spoke," choosing Biden.

                "And here again in Michigan, it's not a razor-thin margin," he said. "It's 154,000 votes. You've got
                to
                let
                those votes stand." </p><br>
