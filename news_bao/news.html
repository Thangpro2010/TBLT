            <h4><strong> By Noah Rothman, associate editor of COMMENTARY magazine </strong></h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Donald Trump’s ascension to lead the Republican Party began as a hostile takeover. It is now ending as a
                hostage crisis.</p><br>

            <p>“This election was rigged,” the president insisted amid a 46-minute diatribe delivered from the White
                House. “Everybody knows it.”</p><br>

            <p>It was not. There is no evidence to the contrary. And as even Republican-led states continue to certify
                the votes that will deliver the presidency to President-elect Joe Biden on Jan. 20, 2021, the true
                believers in Trump’s orbit are reduced to endorsing daffy conspiracy theories to justify their claims.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                A vast plot involving foreign communists, turncoat Republicans, George Soros, Black Lives Matter,
                Antifa, the Clinton Foundation, and half a dozen other nefarious specters that haunt the fevered
                nationalist mind is afoot. Republicans who are still beholden to the movement that clings to Trump’s
                coattails are enabling this facially bankrupt and insulting nonsense. And yet, political necessities do
                sometimes compel them to acknowledge reality. </p><br>

            <p> Terrified as they are by the shadows that dance across the wall and afraid to test the newfound
                liberation delivered by America’s voters, the GOP is starting to comment on a possible Trump 2024
                campaign. Some prominent Republicans told Politico reporters they were enthusiastic about the idea,
                while others were more reluctant to stake out a position. Regardless, contemplating the prospect
                implicitly admits the president’s defeat. And although he is loathe to admit it, Trump’s own behaviors
                betray his failure at the polls and the shift in his focus toward maintaining control over a party he no
                longer titularly leads.
            </p><br>

            <p> Until now, Trump has exerted control over skeptics of his movement within the Republican Party through
                fear. Cross him, and he’ll come after you — your fundraising, your base voters, your reputation on Fox
                News and on AM radio. And it worked, in part, because Trump’s appeal to the Republican primary
                electorate remains largely unchanged from 2016. Four years ago, the reality TV star-turned-candidate
                argued that a vast array of unseen (yet omnipresent) forces were coming for regular Americans.
                “Globalist” free traders, Republican quislings, and half a dozen other interests that are at once
                hyper-competent manipulators of events and yet also reliably bumbling failures were eroding
                opportunities for the common man (and woman). Trump seems inclined to flog that same message all the way
                into 2024 — only now, he has been robbed of that which was his due, too. </p><br>

            <p> But the president cannot predicate his return to national politics on grievance alone. Trump 2016 was a
                hypothetical onto which voters could, and very often did, project their fondest aspirations. Trump 2024
                has a concrete record to run on — or, perhaps, run from. While Trump may not be one for long-term
                strategizing, the people around him certainly are.


            </p><br>
            <p>
                Trump has spent the days since the election wallowing in self-pity. For weeks, he ceased to function as a constitutional officer and instead existed as an astrophysical jet projecting paranoia across the political spectrum. But this week, the White House sputtered back to life with a renewed focus on a nagging priority that cannot wait for Biden to take the oath of office: economic relief to mitigate the pandemic’s terrible second-order effects.  </p><br>

                <p> On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., reengaged on the subject of Covid-19 relief for the first time since October. White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany insisted on Wednesday that economic assistance was “the current active policy priority” for the White House.
            </p><br>

            </p><br>
            <p>
                The president himself seems more interested in licking his wounds than concerning himself with the state of the GOP. But those around him aren’t so self-absorbed, and they seem to be doing what they can to make the final days of the Trump era as painless for the Republican Party as possible. Trump might believe his legacy is secure, and grievance alone will resurrect his political fortunes. If that belief is widely shared by Trump’s fellow Republicans, they’re sure not acting like it.
