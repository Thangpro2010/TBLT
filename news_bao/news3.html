            <h4><strong>By Suzy Khimm</strong></h4>
            <br>
            <p>
                Nursing home residents and staff members will be among the first people in the United States to receive
                the coronavirus vaccine.

            </p><br>

            <p>But there are significant challenges to overcome before the vaccine is broadly administered to this high-risk population, which has been hit harder than any other by the pandemic.</p><br>


            <p>The federal government has contracted with CVS and Walgreens to distribute the vaccine to long-term care facilities and open on-site clinics to vaccinate residents. That’s no small logistical feat, but it’s far from the only hurdle this mass vaccination effort faces.
            </p><br>
            <p>
                Each state has to figure out where long-term care staff members must go to get vaccinated; some may have to go off-site. Public health officials are also confronting hesitancy among some workers, as well as residents and their family members, about getting a new vaccine that some are concerned has not been sufficiently tested on elderly, medically frail people.</p><br>

            <p>And even the many nursing home residents and workers who want to be vaccinated as soon as possible could face a wait in some states. Vaccine clinics are expected to be up and running inside long-term care facilities by the end of December, pending federal approval, according to the American Health Care Association, an advocacy group for long-term care providers.
            </p><br>

            <p>But initial supplies won’t be enough to cover all the nation’s estimated 21 million health care workers and 3 million long-term care residents — the two groups a federal advisory panel recommended prioritizing — forcing states to decide who should go ahead of the others. </p><br>

            <p>While nearly all states are making long-term care residents and staff a top priority, their vaccine distribution plans vary. New York, for example, announced Thursday that its initial batch of 170,000 doses will go to nursing home staff members and residents, while Kentucky said its first shipment of the vaccine will be split between hospitals and long-term care facilities.

            </p><br>
            <p>By contrast, Utah will send the vaccine to front-line workers in five large hospitals first, and long-term care residents and staff will be vaccinated afterward, along with other hospital and health care workers. And Mississippi is planning to vaccinate police, firefighters and other first responders, in addition to hospital workers, before people in nursing homes.</p>
            <br>

            

            <p>“There has to be an infrastructure in place before helping others,” said Liz Sharlot, a spokeswoman for the Mississippi State Department of Health.

            </p><br>
