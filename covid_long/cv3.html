            <h4><strong> By Long TBLT</strong></h4>

            <br>
            <p>On the afternoon of November 30, the manager of singer Bao Anh received information from the Brittanya
                Karma family that she had passed away because of COVID-19. "I still don't believe it's true, just hope
                it's a rumor until the information is confirmed from Karma's family in Germany. A positive energy is
                turned off, a girl who is always full of energy, you will always be. Confident and full of energy
                wherever you are Karma. Rest in peace "- the manager reminded.</p>
            <br>

            <p>In November, Brittanya Karma shared a photo on Facebook saying she was in great pain from COVID-19
                infection and hoped the epidemic would soon pass. On November 20, she announced that she was still
                fighting but feeling sad.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Brittanya Karma is famous for her inspirational ability and confidence despite weighing over 100kg and is
                often the victim of body contempt. Born in Germany, she still tends to Vietnam and often uses Vietnamese
                in her vlogs or MVs. Her famous MV is Confidence, which aims to encourage young people to overcome their
                inferiority complex.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Brittanya Karma once shared: "Millions of people around the world each day endure judgments for their
                differences: short, fat, skinny, ugly, gay, lesbian, transgender, defects in the body ...

                I advise you to turn those into a captivating difference. The only thing you can do is don't let them
                take away their confidence. That is our positive energy. "</p>
            <br>

            <p>Having collaborated with Karma in the dance version of the song Lazarus, singer Bao Anh shared: I
                collaborated with Karma because Karma's rap made me see her positivity. When I first met, I fell in love
                with it because Karma radiates a positive, sincere and lovely energy. She also called me the 'queen' in
                her heart and promised to return to Vietnam this November.</p>
            <br>

            <p>I really appreciate Karma's talent and hip hop quality, I have always wanted to work with Karma again,
                stand on the same stage again. But there will not be again, Karma will not be able to win the epidemic
                of the century. I hope Karma will rest and I will always remember her. Love you, Brittanya Karma ".</p>
            <br>

            <p>The news of Brittanya Karma's death caused many Vietnamese artists and audiences to mourn because she was
                a beloved character. Artists Nha Phuong, Cao Thai Son, rapper Tien Dat, musician Mew Amazing, Ai Phuong
                ... expressed their feelings of shock and condolences to their families.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Musician Mew Amazing wrote: "Thank you for bringing joy and laughter into this world, Brittanya. This
                makes me very sad."

                Brittanya Karma was born in 1991, is the owner of the vlog channel with her name and a hip hop artist.
                She participated in the reality show The Bachelor Vietnam in 2018 and went back to Vietnam to perform.
