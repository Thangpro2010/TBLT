            <h4><strong>By Carmen Sesin</strong></h4>
            <br>

            <p>Miami — As states battle the pandemic, job losses and food insecurity, food banks in Florida and across
                the country are bracing for a dwindling supply of food as federal aid nears its end and Congress stalls
                on a mew stimulus package.</p>
            <br>

            <p>The South Florida metro area ranks among the top in the country for food insecurity, with people lining
                up outside food distribution sites by 11 p.m. the night before.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Feeding South Florida has been distributing food to over 1,000 families per week</p>
            <br>

            <p>While demand has not let up, Feeding South Florida president and CEO Paco Vélez is worried about the
                diminishing food supply.</p>
            <br>

            <p>In the first few months of the pandemic, Feeding South Florida received 160 tractor trailer loads of food
                per week. In the second phase, from July to August, Vélez said it declined to 110; after that it
                plummeted to 60 loads per week. During the current phase that ends Monday, only 14 loads have been
                received.</p>
            <br>

            <p>“We’re still in triage mode. We continue to bring in as much food and get out as much food as we possibly
                can,” said Vélez.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Vélez said some food banks, like Feeding South Florida, rely on the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic
                Security (CARES) Act to acquire food. The food banks themselves don’t receive the funding; the ones who
                do are the distributors they use to bring in produce, dairy, and protein as part of the USDA's Farmers
                to Families Food Box Program.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Pres. Donald Trump signed the CARES Act at the end of March, but negotiations for another deal have been
                ongoing for five months. Republicans and Democrats have blamed each other for their inability to move
                ahead.</p>
            <br>

            <p><img src="../images/covid-19_img/cv16.jpg" alt="" width="100%"></p>
            <p>Cars lined up to receive food at a food distribution at Palm Beach Outlets in West Palm Beach, Florida on
                7/21/2020</p>
            <br>

            <p>Florida unemployment has fallen greatly since its peak. Gov. Ron DeSantis reopened the state in September
                allowing restaurants and bars to operate at full capacity. But Florida still ranks number 12 among the
                states with the highest number of unemployment claims.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Vélez thinks some restaurant owners are trying to “spread the wealth” and for example, hire eight
                part-time workers rather than four full-time employees. Others who are working again, even if they’re
                full-time, are trying to catch up on rent, mortgages, and bills.

                “That’s where we come in and try to offset some of these costs for families so they can use some of
                their income to pay for their mortgage or rent while we help them put food on the table,” said Vélez.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>Farm Share, another Florida-based food bank, has had an uptick in demand since the amount of Covid cases
                began to rise again and federal unemployment benefits have run out.</p>
            <br>

            <p>CEO Steve Shelley said the last round of the Farmers to Families program was supposed to end Dec. 30, but
                most of the allocated food boxes for the state of Florida have already been essentially distributed.</p>
            <br>

            <p>“Next week may be the last week that we receive any food under that program, unless it is renewed by
                Congress or the U.S. Department of Agriculture,” said Shelley.</p>
            <br>

            <p>“We still have other sources of food, but I will say the Farmers to Families Food Box program has been
                one of the greatest stopgaps,” said Shelley.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Shelley said the lines they're seeing may not be as robust as they were at the beginning of the pandemic,
                but he thinks it’s partly because the number of food distributions and the availability of food has
                grown.</p>
            <br>

            <p>“You’re seeing that demand spread out over a larger number of events rather than a smaller number of
                events daily,” Shelley said.

                The U.S. surpassed 13 million coronavirus cases as a third wave has hit most of the country causing
                partial lockdowns in some states and need for greater food supply.</p>
