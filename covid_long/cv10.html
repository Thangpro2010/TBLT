            <h4><strong>By Sara G. Miller</strong></h4>
            <br>

            <p>As a New Jersey hospital faced a surge of Covid-19 cases in the spring, another deadly foe was quietly
                spreading among its patients: a drug-resistant bacterial infection.</p>
            <br>

            <p>The superbug outbreak, detailed in a report published Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and
                Prevention, shows how the coronavirus can overwhelm a hospital, straining care and leaving patients
                vulnerable to other unwanted outcomes.</p>
            <br>

            <h2><i>Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak</i></h2>
            <br>

            <p>Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumanii, or CRAB, is a drug-resistant bacterium known to spread in
                hospitals, particularly in intensive care units. It can cause pneumonia as well as wound, blood and
                urinary tract infections, according to the CDC. Carbapenem, a powerful antibiotic, is ineffective at
                treating the infection.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Not all patients get sick — in some cases, the bacteria can "colonize" the body, but not cause an
                infection. These patients can still spread the bacteria to others.</p>
            <br>

            <p><video
                    src="../video/Dr  John Torres on rising COVID 19 cases  'PPE shortages could happen in a heartbeat' (360p).mp4"
                    controls width="100%"></video></p>
            <br>

            <p>The outbreak was first detected in the unnamed New Jersey hospital on May 28, according to the CDC
                report. Further investigation by the hospital and the state health department identified a total of 34
                patients who had caught the superbug from February to July. Typically, the hospital sees up to two cases
                a month.</p>
            <br>

            <p>The majority of the cases — 82 percent — occurred in March through June, when the hospital was facing a
                surge of Covid-19 patients, and with it, severe shortages in necessary staff, supplies and equipment.
            </p>
            <br>

            <p>The bacteria pose a threat to hospitalized patients because they can survive on surfaces for a long time,
                according to the CDC. Contaminated surfaces must be rigorously cleaned and disinfected to prevent
                outbreaks.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Such infection control measures, however, took a hit during the hospital's Covid-19 surge. Personal
                protection equipment was reused, for example. Fewer screening tests for the bacteria were given to
                patients, because of staff shortages and higher-need patients.</p>
            <br>

            <p>The report also noted that before the pandemic, key parts of a ventilator were changed every 14 days. To
                conserve equipment during the surge, however, the hospital switched to replacing these parts only when
                they were visibly soiled or malfunctioning.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Twenty-five of the 34 patients either infected or colonized with the bacteria were on ventilators at the
                time.</p>
            <br>

            <p>Twenty of the 34 patients did become infected, including 11 patients with Covid-19. Fourteen developed a
                form of pneumonia linked to the bacterial infection, four of whom also had bacteremia, a blood
                infection. A total of 10 patients died, and one remains hospitalized, according to the report.

                It wasn't until late May that the hospital was able to resume normal operations — and with that, CRAB
                cases fell.</p>
