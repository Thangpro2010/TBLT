        English Premier League star Wilfried Zaha says that he is too "scared to even look up my direct messages" because of the amount of abuse he gets on social media. Zaha opened up about the horrific messages he received from a 12-year-old boy on Instagram, and the backlash that followed when he raised awareness
    Life is a permanent holiday at Bondi Beach, a quintessential picture postcard of the Australian lifestyle.

Sun worshippers and surfers share the waves and white sand against a backdrop of cafes, restaurants and shops. Fitness fanatics love the outdoor lifestyle, beach, clifftop walking trails and ocean pools. Socialites have no shortage of hip bars, trendy cafes and upmarket restaurants to dine at, and investors experience high rental demand and strong long-term consistent returns.

Established in the late 1800s as a public beach, the introduction of public transport, followed by amenities including a kiosk, a bandstand, parks, pedestrian facilities and a pavilion for events in the 1930s, attracted even larger crowds and up to 60,000 people daily during summer weekends.

                <h1><b>30-day healthy living plan of a fitness coach</b></h1>
                <hr>
                <img src="../images/healthy_img/sk7.jpg" alt="" width="75%"><br><br>
                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">The four main points of Coach Joe Wicks' mental and physical fitness plan
                    include eating, exercising, setting goals, and getting good sleep.

                    Joe Wicks is a renowned fitness coach (coach) on The Body Coach channel. His "PE with Joe" program
                    also reached millions of followers on Youtube. Recently, he shared his practice experience as well
                    as a 30-day health care plan called "30 Day Kick Start" to have good fitness for the last days of
                    the year.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">1.Reasonable diet, creating comfort <br>
                    <img src="../images/healthy_img/sk7_1_1.jpg" alt="" width="75%"> <br><br>

                    According to Joe, diet should create comfort, should not overdo it, help you enjoy a variety of food
                    sources. "I want you to eat delicious and delicious food, but the key to my plan is consistency:
                    Focus on homemade dishes with reasonable serving sizes, instead of processed foods, drinks that are
                    gas, fast food and alcohol, "Joe said.Besides, minimize the consumption of foods containing starch
                    and sugar. Examples include corn, potatoes, cassava, rice, confectionery and even fruit high in
                    sugar. Replace with protein (protein) and fat in foods such as meat, fish, eggs, milk ... However,
                    you do not need to completely remove carbohydrates from the menu. It is important to enjoy the right
                    carbs after workouts to recharge and strengthen your muscles.

                    Take some time to exercise before meals. For example, if you like a plate of pasta for dinner,
                    schedule an afternoon or early evening workout. If you like breakfast porridge, wake up and exercise
                    in the morning.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">2.Exercise and rest in a balanced manner <br>

                    Joe thinks that there should be a reasonable exercise regimen and appropriate rest. "I exercise five
                    days a week and rest for two days," says Joe. For your body to recover from a workout is important, 
                    so the rest days are just as important as the days of exercise for overall health. <br><br>
                    3. Set realistic goals <br>

                    Another key to Joe's 30-day plan success is goal setting. Goals don't have to be big, and they don't
                    have to be based on body weight or weight. If your goals are unrealistic and your expectations are
                    too high, you will be less likely to achieve them.

                    Don't feel discouraged by not achieving something either, as this may lead to you wanting to give up
                    completely. Sometimes the goals are very simple. For example, a possible short-term goal is: "I'm
                    not going to drink a carbonated drink or alcohol today, I'll just drink water" or "I'll go to bed an
                    hour earlier each night this week." . All these small wins really add up and make a big difference
                    in a month or a year. <br> <br>

                    4. The importance of sleep <br>
                    <img src="../images/healthy_img/sk7_2_1.jpg" alt="" width="75%"> <br> <br>
                    After giving birth, Joe shared, he really felt the negative effects of lack of sleep. During those
                    early weeks, Joe found it difficult to practice on a regular basis. "I tried to do something, even
                    if I only walked 20 minutes to clear my mind, but still felt difficult sometimes," Joe recalls.

                    Up to 90% of depressed people have poor sleep, which makes the body tired. It's important to take
                    care of your sleep as well as take care of your body. Pay attention to your space, see if it is
                    peaceful, relaxing and orderly or not? You can use other supportive measures like listening to
                    meditations, turning off your mobile devices and relaxing with music or reading a book before bed.
