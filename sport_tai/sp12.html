12.President Trump is about to hit the 300 mark of golf when in office

Over the weekend, President Trump spent two consecutive days golfing at his Virginia-owned golf course. According to Golf News Net, this is the 296 and 297 Trump's visit to a golf course since he became the 45th President of the United States on January 20, 2017.

Trump reportedly moved to the golf course of the same name just before 10:00 a.m. on November 14 and repeated that the next day. On the same day, Trump also sent various messages, saying Biden first won the election via a Twitter post but later said he did not admit to anything and continued to accuse election fraud.
A full week ago, when the representative of Biden Democrat was declared victory by the major media, based on the results of the vote count of each state, Mr. Trump was also on the golf course. Even when "lost", Trump continued to his golf course in Virginia.

Trump has only three more such trips left to hit the 300 mark on a golf course during his tenure. In his first year as President, Trump played golf 91 times. The number in the second year is 76 and the third year is 91. It all took place at Trump's golf course, except for a joint battle with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and professional star Hideki Matsuyama (November / 2017), the same time remained with Mr. Abe in May 2019.

28.Ferrari records worst home qualifying performance since 1984

Sebastian Vettel didn't make it out of the first qualifying round and could only muster a lowly 17th place, while teammate Charles Leclerc made it into the second qualifying round but could only claim 13th on the grid ahead of Sunday's race.
Ferrari knew it would struggle for speed coming into this weekend's Italian Grand Prix, but even they couldn't have predicted things would be this bad.
Leclerc sits in fifth place in the drivers' championship with 45 points, already 112 points behind runaway leader Lewis Hamilton. Things are even worse for four-time world champion Vettel, who only has 16 points and sits in 13th place.
In the constructors' standings, Ferrari is in 5th place and a whopping 203 points behind leader Mercedes.
One miniscule silver lining for Ferrari is that its fervent supporters -- known as the 'tifosi' -- were not present to witness the disastrous performance, with races still being driven behind closed doors.

"At the end, we expected it a little bit coming into the weekend," a visibly frustrated Leclerc told Sky Sports. "We knew Spa [last weekend] and here were the two worst tracks for us. It's like this ... it's tough.
"For now, it's like this and I need to extract the maximum out of the car. It hurts even more that it's at home. This is the reality for us at the moment. We need to work," Leclerc said.
At the top of the leaderboard, Mercedes recorded yet another 1-2 as Lewis Hamilton secured his 8th pole at the Italian Grand Prix, with teammate Valtteri Bottas narrowly losing out by one tenth of a second to start second on the grid.
"It was a fantastic performance from the team," Hamilton told Sky Sports. "It wasn't the easiest, you've seen how close it was between us. It needed a clean lap and I got both.


"Valtteri was strong and kept pushing, I was a bit nervous going through the final sector. In the years I've been here, I've had times when we had less downforce and grip, [but] the speed through the Lesmos [corner] was awesome. It's trying to finds the right balance which is not so easy," Hamilton said.
McLaren's Carlos Sainz put in arguably the performance of the day to secure 3rd for his best ever grid spot, while Racing Point driver Sergio Perez's 4th place equaled his best ever qualifying position.

Top 10
1. Hamilton
2. Bottas
3. Sainz
4. Perez
5. Verstappen
6. Norris
7. Ricciardo
8. Stroll
9. Albon
10. Gasly


30.'Riding a horse is like flying a plane': Ben Maher on the secrets of his success

If there was a magical formula to succeeding in the Longines Global Champions Tour (GCT), then Ben Maher would appear to have a good idea what it is.

The Briton is the reigning LGCT champion and is currently leading the standings in this season’s competition — earning over $2.7 million in the last three years of equestrian’s elite competition.

His career accolades also include a prestigious Olympic gold medal which he won competing at London 2012.

So what are the secrets of his success?

Building relationships
You need to form a lasting bond with your horse and knowing how your ride feels before, during and after competition is a vital ingredient to winning on the biggest stage, Maher says.

“Riding a horse is like flying a plane, they’re not machines but it’s a lot of hours, a lot of time to go into building the relationship,” he told CNN Sport’s equestrian show.

Creating and maintaining that special bond is something that tests every rider at the top of the sport but Maher must also balance it with his booming equestrian business.

In addition to competing, the 36-year-old also trains riders — including some of his competitors — as well as horses.

“We don’t spend every day of every week with these horses. We have to fly around to different locations juggling the horses,” he said.

“It’s the rider’s job to really understand what makes the horse work and try to think ahead of the horse so we understand what’s going to happen and how the horse feels on that day.”

Mental fortitude
Such prolonged success at the top of any sport can only be achieved through hard work and Maher says staying in good physical condition is an important factor.

He also credits communication and mental fortitude as vital ingredients for success, especially when things are going wrong.

“As a sport, we lose a lot more than we win,” he said.

However, looking after yourself is only one half of the battle when it comes to showjumping, you must also rely on the quality of your horse.

When both components are in place, success becomes a whole lot easier to obtain.

“Some of the best horses have the biggest hearts,” he continued.

“The best horses walk through the gates and they grow and rise to the occasion. They feel like they can do anything and that gives the rider confidence in return.”





22.Arsenal in the round of 1/16 Europa League

Arsenal beat Molde 3-0 in the fourth match of the Europa League group stage on the evening of November 26, thus soon gaining the right to enter the knockout round.

With 12 points in four games, Arsenal soon completed their group stage goal. Coach Mikel Arteta's team also only needed one more point in the next match with Rapid Wien to ensure that they could keep the top of Group B. Contrary to the volatile form in the Premier League, Arsenal showed a completely different face when playing in Europa League. 12 of their last 13 goals are in the continental arena, the other in the Premier League is Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's penalty kick against Man Utd.

Aubameyang was not in the squad to Molde, leaving a spearhead for juniors Eddie Nketiah. The 21-year-old player paired with Alexander Lacazette, and Nicolas Pepe was assigned to play in the right midfield. The layout of Coach Arteta helps "Gunners" create many attacking options, in the context that Molde is forced to seek a victory to maintain the opportunity to continue.
The home side entered the game not badly and almost opened the scoring in the 15th minute when Sheriff Sinyan finished out in front of the open goal. On the other side of the goal, Arsenal strikers also missed a few delicious situations after a quick counterattack. Pepe, who was red carded in the match against Leeds, played aggressively as if to atone.

At the beginning of the second half, Arsenal's expensive contract had a technical ball from the right wing before cutting the ball of his left foot to hit the bar. Pepe did not have to regret long because soon after, the French striker received the ball in the penalty area and then tore Molde with another set of his left foot. This is Pepe's third goal after four Europa League appearances this season.
