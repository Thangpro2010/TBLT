                <h1><b>Felicity Huffman sports a Carnegie Mellon University sweatshirt to drop off daughter Sophia at
                        the airport ... one year after going to prison for her role in college admissions scandal</b>
                </h1>
                <hr>
                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">It's been a little over one year since Felicity Huffman served out her
                    prison sentence for her role in the college admissions scandal and what a difference 12 months
                    makes.
                </p>

                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">The 57-year-old actress was spotted proudly showing off her school spirit in
                    a Carnegie Mellon University sweatshirt while dropping her daughter Sophia to the Burbank Airport on
                    Wednesday.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">In 2019, Felicity pleaded guilty to paying an admissions consultant $15,000
                    to have a proctor correct Sophia's answers on the SAT and in October she finally completed her court
                    ordered probation in connection to that conviction.</p>
                <br>

                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">Proud mom: Felicity Huffman was spotted showing off her school spirit in a
                    Carnegie Mellon University sweatshirt while dropping her daughter Sophia to the Burbank Airport on
                    Wednesday - one year after she served time in prison for the college admissions scandal</p>

                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">Following her mom's involvement in what was dubbed operation Varsity Blues,
                    Sophia Macy was accepted into Pittsburgh's prestigious Carnegie Mellon University. </p>

                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">Huffman wore her pride literally on her sleeve as she was seen this week
                    dropping the 19-year-old off to the airport while wearing a hooded sweatshirt emblazoned with the
                    college name.
                </p>

                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">The Desperate Housewives star was dressed down to say her goodbyes in a pair
                    of baggy jeans, the hoodie and a facemask.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">Her blonde hair was pulled back in a low ponytail and she wore a large pair
                    of black rimmed eyeglasses.</p>
                <br>

                <img src="../images/entertainment_img/e26.png" alt="" width="75%"><br><br>
                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">Drama: In 2019, Felicity pleaded guilty to paying an admissions consultant
                    $15,000 to have a proctor correct Sophia's answers on the SAT and in October she finally completed
                    her court ordered probation in connection to that conviction</p>

                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">Guilty: Huffman admitted to paying admissions official William Singer via
                    his nonprofit Key Worldwide Foundation, which authorities said was set up as a front to accept
                    bribes
                </p>

                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">The actress served 11 days out of her 14-day sentence and was released from
                    a federal facility in Dublin, California in October of 2019.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">She was also fined $30,000 after she admitted to paying $15,000 for a
                    proctor to correct wrong answers on her daughter Sophia's SATs.
                </p>

                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">
                    Huffman admitted to paying admissions official William Singer via his nonprofit Key Worldwide
                    Foundation, which authorities said was set up as a front to accept bribes.</p>

                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">'I broke the law,' she said following her sentencing. 'I have admitted that
                    and I pleaded guilty to this crime. There are no excuses or justifications for my actions. Period
                    ... I was frightened. I was stupid, and I was so wrong.'</p>
                <br>

                <img src="../images/entertainment_img/e27.png" alt="" width="75%"><br><br>

                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">Big news: The college freshman revealed on social media in April that she
                    would be following the acting footsteps of her mom and dad, William H. Macy, and had been accepted
                    into the Carnegie Mellon University School of Drama</p>

                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">She added: 'I can promise you that in the months and years to come that I
                    will try and live a more honest life, serve as a better role model for my daughters and family and
                    continue to contribute my time and energies wherever I am needed.'
                </p>

                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">In a letter last fall seeking leniency from the court, Huffman said she
                    engaged in the scheme after her daughter's dreams of going to college and pursuing an acting career
                    were jeopardized by her low math score. </p>

                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">Sophia was kept in the dark about her mother's actions and confronted her
                    after news of the FBI's sweeping Operation 'Varsity Blues' broke, saying, 'Why didnâ€™t you believe in
                    me?' Huffman wrote in her letter. </p>

                <br>
                <img src="../images/entertainment_img/e28.png" alt="" width="75%"><br><br>
                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">Doing anything she could: In a letter last fall seeking leniency from the
                    court, Huffman said she engaged in the scheme after her daughter's dreams of going to college and
                    pursuing an acting career were jeopardized by her low math score</p>
                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">
                    As of last month, Felicity officially finished her supervised release, including 250 hours of
                    community service, according to her legal team, TMZ reported.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">Huffman will now be able to use her passport and travel, though her felony
                    conviction in the states could complicate entry into certain areas.

                    The other Hollywood names uncovered as part of the federal investigation into the bribery scandal
                    included actress Lori Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer, Mossimo Giannulli.
                </p>
                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">Loughlin reported to the Federal Correctional Institution in Dublin on
                    Friday to start her two month sentence and source told UsWeekly that it has not been easy.</p><br>

                    designer Mossimo Giannulli</p>
                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">The 56-year-old star of Full House has been a 'wreck' according to a source
                    who went on to explain: 'Lori tried her best to be brave and look at the end result but there was
                    nothing that could dissipate her fears.' </p>
                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">Meanwhile, Giannulli is set to serve his five-month prison sentence in at
                    the federal prison in Lompoc, California.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">In agreement with their plea deals, Loughlin must also pay fines of $150,000
                    and complete 100 hours of community service.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 2rem;">Giannulli is slated to pay fines of $250,000, finish 250 hours of community
                    service and remain on probation for two years.
